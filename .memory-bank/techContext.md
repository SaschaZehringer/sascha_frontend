# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- Angular framework with TypeScript for frontend development.
- CSS for styling components and layout.
- JSON files for static data storage and dynamic content loading.
- Angular CLI for project scaffolding, building, and serving.
- Karma and Jasmine for unit testing.
- ESLint for code linting and quality enforcement.
- Angular Router for navigation and routing.

## Development Setup
- Node.js and npm used for package management.
- Project dependencies managed via package.json.
- TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.spec.json) set up for compilation.
- Angular.json configures build and project settings.
- EditorConfig for consistent coding styles across editors.

## Technical Constraints
- Frontend only; no backend integration currently.
- Static JSON data limits dynamic content updates without redeployment.
- Responsive design required for multiple device types.
- Accessibility standards to be followed.

## Dependencies
- Angular core and related packages.
- Testing libraries: Karma, Jasmine.
- Linting tools: ESLint.
