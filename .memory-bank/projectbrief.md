# Project Brief

This project is a frontend application named "sascha_frontend" built with Angular. It aims to provide a user interface that likely showcases personal or professional information, given the presence of data files such as education, experience, personal info, projects, and skills. The project is structured with Angular best practices, including modular components and routing.

The core requirements are to deliver a responsive, user-friendly frontend that displays structured data about an individual or entity, possibly for portfolio or resume purposes. The project should be maintainable, scalable, and follow Angular and web development best practices.

The scope includes:
- Displaying personal and professional data
- Navigation through different sections (e.g., navbar component)
- Styling and theming consistent with modern UI standards
- Integration with JSON data assets for dynamic content rendering
- Ensuring build and test configurations are properly set up

This document serves as the foundation for all other memory bank files and guides the development and maintenance of the project.
