# Product Context

The sascha_frontend project exists to provide a clean, modern, and accessible frontend interface that presents detailed personal and professional information. It solves the problem of effectively showcasing an individual's portfolio, skills, experience, education, and projects in a structured and visually appealing manner.

The product is designed to work as a personal portfolio or resume website, allowing users or visitors to navigate through different sections easily via a navbar. The data is dynamically loaded from JSON files, enabling easy updates and maintenance without changing the codebase.

User experience goals include:
- Fast loading times and responsive design for all device types
- Clear navigation and intuitive layout
- Consistent styling and branding using CSS and Angular components
- Accessibility considerations to ensure usability for all users
- Easy maintainability and extensibility for future enhancements

This context guides the development focus on user-centric design and data-driven content presentation.
