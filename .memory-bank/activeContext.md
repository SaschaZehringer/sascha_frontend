# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on maintaining and enhancing the sascha_frontend Angular application. Recent work includes ensuring the project structure is clean, components are modular, and data is loaded dynamically from JSON assets. The navbar component is implemented for navigation, and styling is applied consistently across the app.

## Recent Changes
- Updated project brief and product context documentation in the memory bank.
- Verified presence of key components such as navbar and app component.
- Confirmed data assets structure under src/assets/data for dynamic content.

## Next Steps
- Continue updating memory bank files to cover system patterns, technical context, and progress.
- Review key source files to document system architecture and design patterns.
- Document technologies and dependencies used in the project.
- Track current progress and known issues.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project uses Angular framework with TypeScript.
- Data-driven approach with JSON files for content.
- Modular component design for scalability.
- Styling with CSS, aiming for responsive and accessible UI.
- MCP servers are integrated and used to extend capabilities where applicable.
